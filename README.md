PhD student developing spatiotemporal models to better understand changing extreme weather events in the context of climate change in Ireland.

My main research interests lie in 
- extreme value theory-based methods,
- high-dimensional computational statistics,
- climate change analysis. 

Below you'll find some (hopefully) useful software I have developed!
